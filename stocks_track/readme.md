NSEpy is a library to extract historical and realtime data from NSEâ€™s website.
This Library aims to keep the API very simple.

Python is a great tool for data analysis along with the scipy stack and the main
objective of NSEpy is to provide analysis ready data-series for use with scipy
stack. NSEpy can seamlessly integrate with Technical Analysis library (Acronymed
TA-Lib, includes 200 indicators like MACD, RSI). This library would serve as a
basic building block for automatic/semi-automatic algorithm trading systems or
backtesting systems for Indian markets.
